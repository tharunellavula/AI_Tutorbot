## Level 1 Study Plan: Python Functions (Think Python 2e)

This plan covers the fundamental concepts of functions as presented in Think Python 2e, pages 42-46.

**Total estimated study time:** 4 hours

**Week 1: Understanding Functions**

**(Day 1: Function Definition and Calls - 1 hour)**

* **Subtopic:** Defining functions using `def`, function body, calling functions.
* **Content:** Think Python 2e, pages 42-43 (sections 3.5, parts of 3.6).
* **Activities:**
    * Carefully read and understand the examples of `print_lyrics` and `repeat_lyrics`.
    * Try defining your own simple functions (e.g., one that prints your name, another that adds two numbers).
    * **Exercise:**  Move the function call before the definition and observe the error. Then, rearrange the function definitions as instructed and analyze the results (Think Python 2e, page 43, section 3.6).
* **Important Note:**  Pay close attention to the order of execution of statements in a program. Function definitions create objects, but the code inside them doesn't run until the function is called.


**(Day 2: Function Types and Return Values - 1 hour)**

* **Subtopic:** Fruitful vs. void functions, the `None` value, return values.
* **Content:** Think Python 2e, page 46 (section 3.10).
* **Activities:**
    * Understand the difference between functions that return a value (fruitful) and those that don't (void).
    * Practice using `math` functions (e.g., `sqrt`, `cos`) and observe the return values.
    * Run the examples involving `print_twice` and understand why assigning its output to a variable results in `None`.
* **Important Note:**  In a script, the return value of a fruitful function is lost if not stored in a variable or printed.


**(Day 3: Why Use Functions? - 1 hour)**

* **Subtopic:** Benefits of using functions: code organization, reusability, readability.
* **Content:** Think Python 2e, page 46 (section 3.11).  (Note: This section is partially cut off in the provided text; you may need to consult the full text of the book for a complete understanding).
* **Activities:**
    * Reflect on why functions are important for writing larger, more complex programs.
    * Consider how functions improve code organization, making it easier to read, debug, and maintain.
* **Important Note:** This section highlights the importance of modularity in programming.


**(Day 4: Review and Practice - 1 hour)**

* **Subtopic:** Review of all concepts covered in the week.
* **Activities:**
    * Re-read the relevant sections of the book.
    * Attempt to solve additional exercises from the book related to functions (if available in the provided excerpt).
    * Create more complex functions, combining what you've learned.  For example, create a function that takes two numbers as input, adds them, and then prints the result.


This plan provides a structured approach to learning about functions. Remember to actively engage with the material by writing code and experimenting.  The limited text provided makes extensive exercises difficult to specify, but the suggested activities should provide a good foundation.  Accessing the full text of "Think Python 2e" will greatly enhance this learning plan.

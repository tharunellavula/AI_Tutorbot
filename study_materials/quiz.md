Here's a 10-question multiple-choice quiz on functions based on the provided text, with explanations:

**1.  What is a "traceback" in the context of Python programming?**
    A) A list of variables used in a function.
    B) A type of error that occurs during compilation.
    C) A list of functions that were executing when an error occurred.
    D) A diagram showing the flow of data in a program.

**Correct Answer: C**  A traceback shows the call stack—the sequence of function calls leading to an error.


**2. A function that returns a value is called a:**
    A) Void function
    B) Fruitful function
    C) Parameterized function
    D) Anonymous function

**Correct Answer: B**  The text explicitly defines fruitful functions as those that return a value.


**3. What value is returned by a void function?**
    A)  An empty string ""
    B)  Zero (0)
    C)  `None`
    D)  The function's name

**Correct Answer: C**  The text states that void functions return the special value `None`.


**4.  In a Python script, if you call a fruitful function without assigning its return value to a variable, what happens?**
    A)  A runtime error occurs.
    B)  The program halts execution.
    C)  The return value is discarded (lost).
    D)  The return value is automatically printed to the console.

**Correct Answer: C** The return value is calculated but not stored or used, making it effectively lost.


**5. What is the type of the `None` value in Python?**
    A) `str`
    B) `int`
    C) `bool`
    D) `NoneType`

**Correct Answer: D**  The text explicitly states that `None` has its own type, `NoneType`.


**6.  What happens when a function definition is executed?**
    A) The code inside the function runs immediately.
    B) A function object is created.
    C) An error occurs if the function is not called later.
    D) The function's return value is displayed.

**Correct Answer: B** Function definitions create function objects; the code inside only runs when the function is called.


**7.  What is the correct syntax to define a function in Python?**
    A) `function my_function():`
    B) `def my_function():`
    C) `function my_function {}`
    D) `define my_function():`

**Correct Answer: B** `def` is the keyword used to define functions in Python.


**8.  In the function definition `def print_twice(bruce):`, what is `bruce` called?**
    A) An argument
    B) A return value
    C) A parameter
    D) A variable

**Correct Answer: C**  Inside the function definition, `bruce` is a parameter—a variable that will hold the value of the argument passed to the function.


**9.  Why is it important to define a function before calling it?**
    A)  It improves code readability.
    B)  It prevents runtime errors.
    C)  It makes the code run faster.
    D)  It's a stylistic convention.

**Correct Answer: B** The flow of execution requires that a function be defined before it's called; otherwise, Python will throw a `NameError`.


**10. What does the flow of execution refer to?**
    A) The order in which statements are executed in a program.
    B) The speed at which a program runs.
    C) The amount of memory a program uses.
    D) The number of functions in a program.

**Correct Answer: A** The text explicitly defines flow of execution as the order in which statements are run.
